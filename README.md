# dataflow
Python library that draws data flow animations.

The goal of this library is to provide easy to use animation library using a basic language (Python) to easily create mockups of data flow designs that can be exported as a video file (or image too) to be presented or attached in their pull requests.

### Currently in development stage
To install locally and test, clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/castilloglenn/dataflow```

Then go to the directory

```cd dataflow```

Then type the following in the terminal to install it as local library.

```pip install -e .```

To view example usage, type the following

```make run_example```

A PyGame window will appear, then go to the file `examples/simple.py` and Save it `(Command + S)`.

The circles shall be shown in realtime in the PyGame window. This interactive development feature makes creating animations easy so devs can visualize what they are coding in real-time.
